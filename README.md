# Maker-madness

This is just a repo with the information of the syllabus, as well as a documentation of what is happening and a todo list. For bigger projects we may have to dedicate an entire folder for it, or add more files holding information on those things. 

Syllabus is what we will do, Weekly-Content is the documentation of what is going on.
